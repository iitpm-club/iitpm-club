## Code Of Conduct

In FORCE we maintain a high level of respect towards everyone and we expect everyone to follow our Code Of Conduct.

-   Be friendly and welcoming
-   Be patient Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
-   Being thoughtful Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
-   Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
-   Be respectful In particular, respect differences of opinion.
-   Be charitable: Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
-   When we do disagree, try to understand why.
-   Avoid destructive behavior: Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
-   Unconstructive criticism: don’t merely decry the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
-   Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
-   Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
-   Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group
-   Be mindful of your language. Any of the following behavior is unacceptable
-   Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
